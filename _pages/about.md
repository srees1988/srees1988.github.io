I am an ever-curious data-driven marketer whoâ€™s working for Servcorp as a Global Operations - Senior Marketing Analyst in Predictive Modelling. Before joining Servcorp, I have garnered a solid six years of international work experience in marketing data analytics/science from ACNC, M&C Saatchi Australia & Cognizant Technology Solutions. Over these years, I primarily served as an interface between business units and technology teams to effectively conduct numerous marketing consulting initiatives in cloud computing, machine learning, big data analytics, and business intelligence.

Academically, I am an Electronics Engineering bachelor with a postgraduate degree in Information Technology & Strategic Marketing from University of Technology, Sydney (Outstanding International Students Award Holder in 2014 & 2015).

Professionally, I am immensely inspired by the potential for combining marketing with big data analytics and cloud computing; to provide scalable insights on targeted consumer behavior. Through the years, I have amassed strong skill sets in Data Modelling (R, SQL, Python), Data Visualization (Power BI, Qlik Sense, Tableau) and Data Science (Supervised/Unsupervised ML algorithms in R & Python). What excites me the most about this journey is the infinite possibility to scale up the marketing data analytics/science projects in the cloud (by setting up Linux/ Ubuntu Servers in Amazon/Google/Azure Virtual Machines to do end-to-end reporting automation). In a few years down the road, I see myself working at the forefront of data-driven Marketing Management Consulting. Apart from my academic and professional life, I am keenly interested in traveling, soccer, skydiving, and metaphysics. Being a Permanent Resident (PR), I am entitled to stay and work full-time in Australia & New Zealand.
