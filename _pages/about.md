Hello! I'm Sreejith Sreedharan a.k.a Sree; an ever-curious data-driven marketer whoâ€™s based in Sydney and works for Servcorp as a Global Operations - Senior Marketing Analyst in Predictive Modelling. Before joining Servcorp, I have garnered a solid six years of international work experience in marketing data analytics/science from ACNC, M&C Saatchi Australia & Cognizant Technology Solutions. 

Professionally, I am immensely inspired by the potential for combining marketing analytics with predictive modelling and cloud computing; to provide scalable insights on targeted consumer behavior. Through the years, I have amassed skill sets in **Data Modelling** (R, SQL, Python), **Data Visualization** (Power BI, Qlik Sense, Tableau, ggplot2, matplotlib) and **Data Science** (Supervised/Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms in R & Python) to be a boundless data storyteller in years to come. In a few years down the road, I see myself working at the forefront of data-driven Marketing Management Consulting.

Academically, I am an Electronics Engineering bachelor with a postgraduate degree in Information Technology & Strategic Marketing from University of Technology, Sydney (Outstanding International Students Award Holder in 2014 & 2015). Apart from my academic and professional life, I am keenly interested in traveling, soccer, skydiving, and metaphysics. 

Being an Australian Citizen with Indian lineage, I am entitled to stay and work full-time in Australia, New Zealand, India and US (on E3 visa). Thank you for viewing my profile. That pretty much sums up my story in a nutshell! I can be reached either through my portfolio in [GitHub](https://github.com/srees1988) or in [Linkedin.](https://linkedin.com/in/srees1988/)  

Hope you have a nice day!

Cheers  
Sree
