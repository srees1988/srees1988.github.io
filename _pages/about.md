As a Lead Marketing Data Scientist at Appliances Online, I am constantly seeking new and innovative ways to drive business growth through data-driven insights. With over ten years of international experience in data science and analytics, I have honed my expertise in cloud computing, machine learning, big data analytics, and business intelligence.

Throughout my career, I have worked as a liaison between business units and technology teams, leveraging my strong communication and collaboration skills to effectively lead consulting initiatives. I am passionate about the potential of predictive analytics and cloud computing to provide scalable insights and have developed strong skill sets in data modeling, data visualization, and data science.

I am particularly excited about the possibilities of scaling up data science and analytics projects in the cloud, leveraging Linux/Ubuntu servers in virtual machines to enable end-to-end ML deployment processes. Looking ahead, I see myself at the forefront of data-driven marketing management consulting.

Academically, I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics Engineering and a postgraduate degree in Information Technology & Strategic Marketing from the University of Technology, Sydney, where I was recognized as an Outstanding International Student Award Holder in both 2014 and 2015.

In addition to my professional work, I am an active blogger on Medium, Towards Data Science, Analytics Vidhya, and The Startup. Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, soccer, skydiving, and exploring topics related to metaphysics.

As an Australian citizen with an Indian lineage, I am authorized to work full-time in Australia, New Zealand, India, and the US on an E3 visa.

Hope you have a nice day!
